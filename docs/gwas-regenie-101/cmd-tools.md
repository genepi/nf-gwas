## Table 1 - Command Line Tools to run your GWAS

| **Command** | **Description** | **Examples and additional infos** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pwd` | Will print your present working directory | |
| `ls` | Will print all files and directories within your present working directory | If you put a path (absolute or relative) after `ls` it will print the content of this directory) e.g. `ls /home` will print the content of the folder home; If you add `-l` it will print the files and directories in a list that contains additional information such as permissions |
| `mkdir` | Will make a new directory in your present working directory | `mkdir GWAS` will make a directory called `GWAS` |
| `cd` | Change directories | If you only enter `cd` without an absolute or relative path, it will change to your home directory; Entering `cd ..` will change your current directory to the parent folder; Entering `cd` with an absolute or relative path will change the directory to the respective folder |
| `nextflow run genepi/gwas-regenie -c <nextflow.config> -r v0.1.13 –profile singularity` | Will run the gwas pipeline | Adding `-bg` will continue to run the pipeline even if you close the command line; Adding `-resume` will continue the pipeline with the files that have already been generated by a run of the same config file (e.g. if you only change the settings for the annotation files, it does not have to rerun the whole pipeline); Exchange `<nextflow.config>` with the name of your config file; Version of the pipeline is adapted simply by changing the version (`v0.1.13`); Instead of `singularity` also `docker`and `slurm` are currently available |
| `htop` | Will display the current processes that are running | Hit `q` to quit |
| `vi` | A text editor in Linux that can display the content of a file, an alternative is for example `nano` (it can be used in the same way, but the advantage is that you can immediately start to modify the file) | E.g. enter `vi first-gwas.config` to view the content of the first-gwas.config file;To quit just type in the following command and hit enter `:q!`; After running a GWAS you might notice a `.nextflow.log` file in you folder when you check via FileZilla but you don't see them if you enter ls in the command line because the dot in the beginning of the file means its hidden. However, you can still look at the content of such a file by entering `vi .nextflow.log` |
